Additional Project Information:

1.I included options for specifying the the input file in case you have your own,
  the number of random integers to generate in the input file, and the timer
  time for the signal to end the program and kill everything. 
2.Default for the timer is 100 as specified in the assignment but that is not enough
  time for my program to complete higher number of integers such as 32, 64, 128, etc.
  Therefore, for those you need to make the timer larger by doing for example -t 1000
  which will be plently of time for the program to complete without running out of time.
